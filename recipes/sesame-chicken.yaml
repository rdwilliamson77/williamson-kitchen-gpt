  A go-to at the Williamson house—crispy, savory, and versatile. Great for family dinners or party platters, 
  especially when paired with a tangy dipping sauce.

    A favorite at the Williamson house for many years.
  notes: >
    These are great on their own or served with BBQ sauce or an "oriental" dipping sauce. 
    Works well as a party appetizer or weeknight dinner.
