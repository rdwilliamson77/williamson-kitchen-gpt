ingredients:
  - 3 ripe Hass avocados
  - 1 small white onion, finely chopped
  - 1–2 serrano chiles, finely chopped (seeds optional)
  - 1 small bunch fresh cilantro, finely chopped (about ¼ cup)

  - ½ tsp fine sea salt (or more to taste)
  - Optional: 1 small Roma tomato, seeded and finely chopped

    1. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a medium bowl. Lightly mash with a fork or potato masher, leaving some texture.
  - |
    2. Add the chopped onion, serrano chile, and cilantro to the avocado. Stir gently to combine.

    3. Add lime juice and salt. Stir again, then taste and adjust seasoning as needed. If using, gently fold in the chopped tomato.

    4. Serve immediately, or cover with plastic wrap pressed directly on the surface of the guacamole to prevent browning. Best eaten fresh.
