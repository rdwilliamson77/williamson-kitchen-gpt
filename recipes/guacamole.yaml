ingredients:
  - 6 ripe Hass avocados, divided
  - 1/2 cup finely diced white onion, divided
  - 2 small ripe tomatoes, seeded and chopped
  - "1–2 serrano peppers, finely minced (to taste)"
  - Juice of 2 limes
  - Splash of fresh orange juice (about 1 tbsp)
  - 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
  - 1 tsp kosher salt, or to taste
  - Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
  - 1 tsp finely chopped fresh oregano

instructions:
  - Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and dice the flesh while still in the skin using a paring knife. Then scoop out into a bowl. Set aside half of the avocado chunks for folding in at the end.
  - In a molcajete (or mortar and pestle), combine half of the diced onion, half of the cilantro, the minced serrano, salt, and chopped oregano. Grind into a coarse paste to release oils and flavors.
  - Transfer the paste to a mixing bowl and add the lime juice, orange juice, and remaining onion and cilantro. Stir to combine.
  - Add half of the avocado and mash gently into the mixture, preserving some texture.
  - Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
  - Fold in the remaining avocado chunks and the seeded, chopped tomato. Mix gently to maintain a rustic consistency.
  - Serve immediately, or press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent browning.

notes:
  - To achieve clean, uniform chunks, dice the avocado in the shell before scooping—it saves time and helps preserve texture.
  - Using a molcajete to grind the aromatics creates a richer, deeper flavor base without over-mixing the avocado.
  - Tomatoes should be seeded before chopping to prevent excess moisture.
  - Adjust serrano heat to taste, or substitute with jalapeño for a milder flavor.
  - "**Presentation tip**: For an elevated table presentation, line a low serving bowl, wide platter, or even a traditional molcajete with large green leaf lettuce. Mound the guacamole in the center and garnish with fresh lime wedges around the edges."
