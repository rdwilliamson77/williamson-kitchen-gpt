  A cheesy, savory spin on traditional cornbread with a gentle or bold kick—depending on how many jalapeños you add.
  Excellent baked in a preheated skillet or pan for a crisp edge and moist center.

  - 1/3 cup vegetable oil
  - 2 eggs
  - 1 small can creamed corn
  - 1/2 pound grated cheddar cheese
  - 1 to 3 tablespoons chopped jalapeño peppers (depending on desired heat)

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 375°F and grease and heat an 8x8-inch baking pan.
  - Sift together cornmeal, salt, soda, and garlic powder in a large bowl.
  - In a separate bowl, beat eggs slightly, then mix with buttermilk and creamed corn.
  - Add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture.
  - Stir in onion, vegetable oil, cheese, and jalapeños.
  - Pour batter into the prepared hot pan.
  - Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden and set in the center.
