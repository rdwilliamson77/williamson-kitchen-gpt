  Light and crisp with a sweet undertone from fresh squash and a savory punch from green onions. 
  These fritters make a perfect summer side—especially when squash is abundant.

    Use a nonstick griddle or well-oiled skillet for best results. Cook just as you would pancakes—flip only once.

ingredients:
  - 2 eggs, beaten
  - 4 green onions, chopped fine
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 3 tablespoons flour
  - 3 tablespoons cornmeal
  - 2 teaspoons melted butter
  - 3 cups grated raw squash
  - 2 teaspoons sugar
  - pepper, to taste

instructions:
  - Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl until well combined.
  - Drop by spoonfuls onto a griddle or skillet sprayed with Pam (or lightly greased).
  - Cook like pancakes, turning once, until golden brown on both sides.
