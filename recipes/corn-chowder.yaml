    This chowder takes inspiration from traditional Shaker-style preparations and uses fresh corn, diced bacon, 
    and a slurry of cornstarch for added creaminess. Yukon Gold or other all-purpose potatoes provide body, 
    and the combination of thyme, cumin, and turmeric lends subtle depth and warmth.
ingredients:
  - "3 medium ears fresh yellow or bicolor corn"
  - "4 ounces slab (unsliced) bacon, rind removed and cut into 1/2-inch dice"
  - "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
  - "1 medium onion (7 to 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice"
  - "1/2 large red bell pepper (6 to 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice"
  - "2 to 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped (1/2 teaspoon)"
  - "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin"
  - "1/8 teaspoon turmeric"
  - "1 pound Yukon Gold, Maine, PEI, or other all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice"
  - "3 cups Chicken Stock or Chicken Broth"
  - "Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
  - "2 teaspoons cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons water"
  - "1 cup heavy cream"
for_garnish:
  - "2 tablespoons minced fresh chives or thinly sliced scallions"
instructions:
  - "Husk the corn. Carefully remove silk and rub ears with a towel. Cut kernels from cobs and place in a bowl (you should have about 2 cups). Scrape down cobs to extract milky substance and add to corn."
  - "In a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot, add diced bacon over low heat. Cook until crisp and golden. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat, leaving bacon in the pot."
  - "Add butter, onion, red pepper, thyme, cumin, and turmeric. Sauté for about 8 minutes, until vegetables are tender but not browned."
  - "Add corn kernels, potatoes, and stock. Turn up heat, cover, and boil vigorously for 10 minutes. Some potatoes will break up slightly; most should retain shape."
  - "Reduce heat to medium. Season with salt and pepper. Stir cornstarch slurry into pot, stirring constantly. Bring back to a boil and cook until thickened slightly. Remove from heat and stir in cream. Adjust seasoning if needed."
  - "If not serving immediately, let cool and refrigerate. Otherwise, let sit at room temperature up to 1 hour for flavors to meld."
  - "When ready to serve, reheat over low heat without boiling. Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with chives."
notes:
  - "Makes about 7 cups. Serve as a first course or a light meal. This recipe is particularly good with common crackers, corn sticks, or skillet cornbread."
