  A foundational salsa roja that begins with broiled Roma tomatoes, serrano peppers,
  garlic, and onion. A splash of fresh tomato and lime rounds out the flavor and
  texture, making it equally great for tacos, eggs, chips, or beans.

ingredients:
  - 2–3 lbs ripe Roma tomatoes, halved
  - 1 large onion, halved
  - 4–6 garlic cloves, unpeeled
  - 2–3 serrano peppers
  - 1 small fresh tomato, diced
  - 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
  - Juice of 1–2 limes
  - Salt, to taste
  - Pepper, to taste

instructions:
  - Preheat broiler.
  - Place Roma tomato halves skin-side up on a sheet pan with onion, garlic, and peppers.
  - Broil for 8–10 minutes, or until skins blister and blacken.
  - Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.
  - Peel garlic; remove pepper stems.
  - Blend charred vegetables in a food processor along with the fresh diced tomato.
  - Add lime juice, salt, pepper, and cilantro. Pulse until just combined, leaving some texture.
  - Strain excess liquid for a thicker consistency, if desired.

  options:
    - To create a **Tex-Mex chipotle version**, add 1–2 chipotles in adobo sauce along with a spoonful of the adobo liquid during blending. This creates a smoky, slightly sweet variation with deep red color and bold flavor, perfect for grilled meats or queso fundido.
    - To create a **traditional Oaxacan-style salsa de chile pasilla**, substitute dried pasilla or chile negro for the fresh serranos. Toast the dried chiles on a skillet until aromatic, then soak in hot water until soft. Blend with the other ingredients. Use less tomato for a darker, more chile-forward profile.
    - For a **taquería-style table salsa**, reduce the tomatoes to 1 lb and add a splash of water during blending for a thinner, pourable texture. Increase garlic slightly. This version is typically mild and served at room temperature alongside tacos.
    - For a **tomatillo-roja hybrid**, replace half of the Roma tomatoes with husked, halved tomatillos. Broil and blend them together for a tangier salsa that pairs well with pork or chicken enchiladas.
    - To make a **creamy salsa roja**, add half an avocado or a spoonful of crema or sour cream to the blended salsa. Blend until smooth. Great with chips or drizzled over breakfast tacos.

notes: >
  This salsa holds well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. It improves in flavor overnight. Always taste for seasoning before serving, as acidity and heat can mellow over time.
