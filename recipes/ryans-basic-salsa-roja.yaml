  A foundational salsa roja that begins with broiled Roma tomatoes, serrano peppers,
  garlic, and onion. A splash of fresh tomato and lime rounds out the flavor and
  texture, making it equally great for tacos, eggs, chips, or beans.

ingredients:
  - 2–3 lbs ripe Roma tomatoes, halved
  - 1 large onion, halved
  - 4–6 garlic cloves, unpeeled
  - 2–3 serrano peppers
  - 1 small fresh tomato, diced
  - 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
  - Juice of 1–2 limes
  - Salt, to taste
  - Pepper, to taste

instructions:
  - Preheat broiler.
  - Place Roma tomato halves skin-side up on a sheet pan with onion, garlic, and peppers.
  - Broil for 8–10 minutes, or until skins blister and blacken.
  - Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.
  - Peel garlic; remove pepper stems.
  - Blend charred vegetables in a food processor along with the fresh diced tomato.
  - Add lime juice, salt, pepper, and cilantro. Pulse until just combined, leaving some texture.
  - Strain excess liquid for a thicker consistency, if desired.

notes: >
  This salsa holds well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. It improves in flavor overnight. Always taste for seasoning before serving, as acidity and heat can mellow over time.
