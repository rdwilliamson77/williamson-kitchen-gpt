    You can use canned sweet potatoes in place of fresh. This dish works well as a side or even a dessert-like addition to a holiday plate.

  - 4 cups sweet potatoes
  - 3 eggs
  - 3/4 cup white sugar
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
  - 1 1/2 sticks butter, melted (divided)
  - 1/2 cup flour
  - 3/4 cup pecans
  - 1 1/2 cups brown sugar
