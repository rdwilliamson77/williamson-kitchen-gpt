  A puffed oven pancake with roots in southern Sweden, adapted lovingly through generations in the Witherspoon family.
  Best eaten hot with lemon juice and powdered sugar or a dollop of jam. 
  It rises dramatically in the oven—then falls—and that’s the beauty of it.

    A puffy, bready, eggy treat for breakfast — 
    “Have Beth serve this to you when you visit Nashville!” – JW

    This dish is a Swedish oven-baked pancake traditionally called *Äggakaka*.
    It originated in the southern province of Skåne and is known for its rich, custard-like texture, but it came to the Williamson family from dear friend Nancy Commoli in the eatly 1980s. It has earned permanent placement on the Chrustmas morning menu.
    In Sweden, it’s often served with lingonberry preserves or bacon but we prefer it with powdered sugar, lemon juice, or jam.
