    I'm first made this dish after a trip to New Orleans for Tim Mangrum's 40th birthday. I don't recall what prompted me to do it 
    but I was compelled to find authentic andioulle sausage while I was there. One day while our group was at our French Quarter 
    hotel pool, I ventured out to Laplace, Louisiana to find Jacob's Andioulle Sausage. This kind of authentic andioulle is virtually 
    impossible to find outside of Cajun country and I'd hit the gold mine. Then, later in the trip I had Shrimp and Grits at 
    Commander's Palace and the stage was set. Access to amazing ingredients like from Jacob's and my new found appreciation for 
    top notch Cajun and Creole cuisine resulted in my obsession with shrimp and grits.

    A number of things happened on that trip that influenced my cooking. First, I experienced the legendary Commander's Palace 
    where I had Shrimp and Grits. I bought their cookbook that day and it has an honored place in my collection. While there are 
    likely better and trendier restaurants in New Orleans, Commander's Palace set the standard long ago.

    These grits are especially creamy, and the sauce is built like a pan sauce—not a gravy. 
    The wine is key to cutting through the richness of the butter and cheese.

    A signature dish at family gatherings. It’s a bridge between comfort food and something a little special, 
    with just enough flair to make it feel like a restaurant dish served at home.

ingredients:
  for the grits:
    - 2 cups stone-ground grits or coarse polenta
    - 4 cups half and half
    - 2 cups chicken stock
    - 1 tsp kosher salt
    - 4 tbsp butter
    - 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated
  for the shrimp:
    - 3 lb large raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
    - 6 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
    - 1 lb andioulle sausage
    - 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
    - 2 cloves garlic, minced
    - 1/2 cup dry white wine
    - 2 cups chicken stock
    - Juice of two lemons
    - 1 tsp smoked paprika
    - 6 sprigs thyme
    - 2 bay leaves
    - 3 tbsp butter
    - 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
    - kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    - 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
    - 1/4 cup sliced scallions

instructions:
  - Bring the stock and half and half to a simmer. Add salt and stir in grits. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently. 
    As the grits cook you'll likely need to fine tune the seasoning and the consistency by adding additional salt and dairy. 
    Once final consistency is achieved, stir in butter and cheese.
  - In a large skillet, cook chopped bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. 
    Leave 1–2 tbsp of bacon drippings in the skillet.
  - Add the onion to the skillet. Sauté 5 minutes until soft. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.
  - Add the butter and 2 tsp flour to make a roux. Cook until blond.
  - Deglaze with white wine, scraping all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add chicken stock, the juice of 2 lemons, 
    thyme, paprika, bay leaves, cayenne pepper, and reserved bits. Bring to a boil for 3–5 minutes. 
    Fine tune seasoning, consistency, and volume. You should have a lightly thickened sauce rather than a thick gravy.
  - Add the andioulle and cook for 2–3 minutes, followed by the shrimp cooking for an additional five minutes.
  - Spoon shrimp and sauce over grits. Garnish with fresh parsley and scallions.

  This dish balances creamy richness with smoky and acidic notes. The wine is key to cutting through 
  the fat and lifting the dish.
