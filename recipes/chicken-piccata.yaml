    This is one of Dad’s signature dishes — rich, bright, and full of personality, just like him. 
    It’s a dish he makes to impress, to comfort, and to share with people he loves. 
    He insists on capers (never olives), and he’s got a near-spiritual opinion on how golden the flour bits should be in the pan.

ingredients:
  - 4 chicken breasts
  - 2–3 lemons
  - 1 cup chicken stock
  - 1 jar capers
  - 1 cup flour
  - 1 cup dry white wine
  - 1 lb linguine
  - 3–4 eggs
  - Vegetable oil (for pan-frying)

instructions:
  - Prep the chicken:
    - Split the chicken breasts and pound them flat — Dad recommends placing them in a gallon freezer bag and pounding with a pollard.
    - Season generously with salt and pepper.
    - Dip in egg wash, then dredge in flour until well coated.

  - Fry the chicken:
    - Heat 1 cup of vegetable oil in a pan.
    - Fry the chicken until golden. Set aside.
    - Dad says: “The bits left in the pan are everything. They should be golden or peanut-colored, never black. If they blacken, you’ve scorched the oil — tough to recover from that.”

  - Build the sauce:
    - Scoop out all but 1 tablespoon of oil and add 1 tablespoon of the used flour.
    - Whisk constantly and deglaze with white wine.
    - Once smooth, add the chicken stock, juice of 2 lemons, and a generous spoonful of capers.
    - Bring to a simmer.
    - Return the chicken to the pan, layer lemon slices on top, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.

  - Cook pasta simultaneously:
    - Boil heavily salted water.
    - Add linguine just as the chicken goes back into the sauce.
    - When pasta is al dente, the piccata is usually ready.

  - Final touches:
    - Evaluate the sauce: it should be loose but cling to pasta.
    - Add reserved pasta water if needed to adjust the consistency.

  - Serve:
    - Plate the chicken over linguine.
    - Serve with warm, crusty baguette for soaking up sauce.
