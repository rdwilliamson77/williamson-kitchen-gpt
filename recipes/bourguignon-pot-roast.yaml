    This soul warming dish bridges the rustic comfort of American pot roast with the nuanced, wine-forward character of French boeuf bourguignon. 
    It is ideal on a cool and rainy fall day. Serve with a crusty rustic sour dough or French bread.
ingredients:
  - item: "3–4 lb chuck roast, well marbled"
  - item: "Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"
  - item: "2 tbsp olive oil"
  - item: "2 tbsp unsalted butter"
  - item: "1 large yellow onion, sliced"
  - item: "4 cloves garlic, smashed"
  - item: "2 tbsp tomato paste"
  - item: "2 cups dry red wine (e.g., Burgundy, Côtes du Rhône, or cabernet)"
  - item: "2 cups beef stock (preferably homemade)"
  - item: "4–5 sprigs fresh thyme"
  - item: "2 bay leaves"
  - item: "1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (optional but deepens flavor)"
  - item: "4 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks"
  - item: "1 lb baby potatoes or halved Yukon Golds"
  - item: "8 oz cremini or white mushrooms, halved"
  - item: "Chopped parsley, for garnish"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C)."
  - "Pat roast dry and season generously with salt and pepper."
  - "In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. Sear roast on all sides until well browned, 3–4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside."
  - "Lower heat to medium. Add butter, onions, and garlic. Sauté until soft and golden, about 6–8 minutes."
  - "Stir in tomato paste and cook 1–2 minutes to deepen flavor."
  - "Pour in red wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom. Simmer 5 minutes."
  - "Add beef stock, thyme, bay leaves, and Worcestershire (if using). Return roast to the pot and bring to a simmer."
  - "Cover and transfer to oven. Braise for 2.5 hours."
  - "Add carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms to the pot. Re-cover and braise another 1–1.5 hours, or until meat and vegetables are fork-tender."
  - "Skim fat if needed. Discard thyme stems and bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning."
  - "Serve in shallow bowls with spoonfuls of broth, garnished with chopped parsley."
notes:
  - "This dish tastes even better the next day. Reheat gently to preserve texture."
  - "Use a bold, dry wine you’d enjoy drinking. Avoid sweet reds or cooking wine."
  - "For a thicker sauce, remove meat and vegetables after cooking and simmer liquid uncovered on the stove until slightly reduced, or stir in a cornstarch slurry."
