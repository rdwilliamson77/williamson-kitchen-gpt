  This recipe has been an often-requested, top family favorite for years. While Ryan’s version of this classic dish diverges in some ways from historical and authentic versions, the end result is perhaps better than the original--with a tangy and bright flavor that is sure to warm your soul.

ingredients:
  - 4 chicken breasts
  - 2–3 lemons (juice of 2, zest of 1, plus slices for garnish)
  - 1 cup dry white wine
  - 3 tbsp capers
  - 1 cup flour (for dredging)
  - 1 lb linguine
  - 3–4 eggs
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 3 tbsp unsalted butter
  - 2 tbsp unsalted butter (for finishing)
  - 1 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  - kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

instructions:
  - Split each chicken breast horizontally and pound thin between two sheets of plastic or in a freezer bag until about ½" thick. Season generously with salt and pepper.
  - Set up two shallow bowls: one with beaten eggs and one with flour. Dip chicken first in the egg wash, then dredge in flour. Shake off any excess.
  - Heat 2 tbsp olive oil + 3 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering and lightly foaming. Sauté chicken in batches until golden brown and just cooked through, about 2–3 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and tent loosely with foil.
  - Pour off excess fat, leaving about 1 tablespoon of drippings in the pan. Add 1 tbsp of flour and whisk to create a light roux. Cook just until blonde, about 1 minute.
  - Add wine, lemon juice/zest, and capers. Simmer until slightly reduced. Off heat, whisk in 2 tbsp cold butter and parsley.
  - Return chicken to the pan and top each cutlet with a lemon slice. Cover and simmer gently for 5–7 minutes to reheat and meld flavors.
  - While the sauce simmers, boil linguine in heavily salted water until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water.
  - Adjust sauce consistency with reserved pasta water as needed. Serve chicken over pasta with sauce spooned over top. Garnish with additional parsley or black pepper if desired.
