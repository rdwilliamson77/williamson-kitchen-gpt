  A hearty, crowd-sized gumbo ideal for holidays or gatherings. The oven-browned flour shortcut makes a complex roux more accessible

    A richly flavored gumbo passed down by Jennifer and Tom Klaiber. The roux is key—Tom suggests browning the flour in the oven 
    to save time and achieve that perfect dark base. This hearty gumbo includes shrimp, crab, and okra, and makes a full gallon—
    perfect for gatherings.
  notes: >
    File powder (pronounced FEE-lay) is made from ground sassafras leaves and is used to thicken and flavor gumbo.  
    It's added at the end and should not be boiled after adding.

ingredients:
  - 1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon bacon drippings
  - 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons flour
  - 2 medium onions, chopped
  - 1 1/2 cups celery, chopped
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
  - 1 (28 oz) can whole tomatoes
  - 1 (16 oz) can tomato sauce
  - 3 cups water
  - 3 cups chicken broth
  - 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
  - 1 tablespoon salt
  - 1 teaspoon pepper
  - 2 pounds shrimp, cleaned
  - 1 1/2 pounds crab meat
  - 1 (16 oz) package okra
  - File powder, to taste
  - Tabasco sauce (optional)

instructions:
  - Combine bacon drippings and flour in a large pot over medium heat. Stir constantly until roux is dark brown. This can take time.
  - (Optional shortcut: Tom recommends spreading the flour on a baking sheet and browning in a 450°F oven, stirring frequently until browned. Then combine with bacon drippings in pot.)
  - Stir in onions, celery, and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until onions are clear.
  - Add whole tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, broth, salt, and pepper. Simmer over medium heat for 1 hour.
  - Add shrimp, crab meat, and okra. Simmer 20 minutes.
  - Stir in Worcestershire sauce and simmer another 10 minutes.
  - Add file powder and Tabasco to taste. Do not boil after adding file.

  Makes 1 gallon. Best served with rice or crusty bread. File thickens the gumbo and adds a subtle earthy flavor.
