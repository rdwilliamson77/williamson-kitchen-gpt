  Known throughout the South as Alabama Fire Crackers, this recipe transforms plain saltines into an
  addictive snack with nothing but oil, dry seasoning packets, and time. They're not baked — the
  magic happens overnight in a sealed container.

ingredients:
  - 1 box (16 oz) saltine crackers (about 4 sleeves)
  - 1 cup canola oil (or another neutral oil)
  - 1 oz packet dry ranch seasoning mix
  - 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
  - 1 teaspoon onion powder (optional)

instructions:
  - In a large mixing bowl or zip-top bag, combine the canola oil, ranch seasoning, crushed red pepper, and optional garlic/onion powder.
  - Stir or shake vigorously until the mixture is fully emulsified.
  - Add the crackers and gently turn or shake until every cracker is evenly coated.
  - Transfer to a large airtight container or gallon zip-top bag.
  - Let sit for at least 12 hours (24 is better), gently turning occasionally to redistribute the seasoning.
  - Serve as-is or with sliced cheese, pimento cheese, or cold beer.

notes: >
  - These store well for up to a week in an airtight container.
  - The spice level can be adjusted — 1 tbsp red pepper makes them milder, 2 tbsp is classic.

  Common across Alabama and Mississippi; this version sticks to the traditional ranch-and-oil blend
  without cheese or baking.
