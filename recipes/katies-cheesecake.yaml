  A beloved Williamson favorite often served during the holidays or special family occasions.
  The texture improves significantly after a full day’s chill, and while it's great with toppings,
  it holds its own without them.

    Can be topped with strawberries or cherry pie filling, but is unbeatable just by itself.  
    A Williamson favorite.
  notes: >
    The original recipe calls for Holland Rusks for the crust, but graham cracker crumbs and margarine are an acceptable substitute. 
    Be sure to chill all day or overnight before serving for best texture.

ingredients:
  crust:
    - 8–10 Holland Rusks
    - 1/2 cup melted margarine

  filling:
    - 4 eggs
    - 1 1/4 cups sugar
    - 3 (8 oz) packages cream cheese

  topping:
    - 2 cups sour cream
    - 1/2 cup sugar
    - 1 teaspoon vanilla

instructions:
  - Crush Holland Rusks and stir into the melted margarine.
  - Press into springform pan. (Crust can also be made with graham cracker crumbs and margarine.)
  - Mix 4 eggs on high speed. Gradually add 1 1/4 cups sugar.
  - Break cream cheese into chunks and add a little at a time, beating on high speed a total of 15 minutes.
  - Pour into springform pan and bake at 350°F for 40 minutes.
  - Mix sour cream with 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla.
  - When cheesecake has cooled for 10 minutes, pour sour cream mixture gently over top.
  - Return to oven for an additional 10 minutes.
  - Chill all day or overnight before serving.
