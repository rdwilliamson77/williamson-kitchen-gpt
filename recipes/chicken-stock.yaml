  This is a classic, crystal-clear chicken stock suited for soups, sauces, braises, and reductions. It forms the backbone of countless recipes and holds its own in any professional kitchen. Made from roasted bones, mirepoix, and aromatics, it’s slowly simmered and carefully strained.

ingredients:
  - 5 lb chicken bones (backs, wings, necks, and/or carcasses)
  - 1 large onion, quartered (skin on for color)
  - 2 carrots, chopped
  - 2 celery stalks, chopped
  - 1 head garlic, halved crosswise
  - 1 small bunch parsley stems
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 1 tsp black peppercorns, whole
  - 1 sprig thyme
  - 1 gallon cold water (plus more as needed)
  - optional: 1 tbsp tomato paste (for richer color and umami)
  - optional: 1 leek (cleaned and chopped)

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 425°F. Spread chicken bones on a sheet pan and roast for 45 minutes until well browned, turning once.
  - In a large stockpot, combine roasted bones, cold water, and any browned bits from the roasting pan.
  - Slowly bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Skim off any foam or scum that rises.
  - Once simmering, add vegetables, herbs, and aromatics. Do not boil; maintain a gentle bubble.
  - Simmer uncovered for 6–8 hours, replenishing water as needed to keep bones submerged.
  - In the final hour, taste the stock for body. Add more time for richness, if needed.
  - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a clean container. Discard solids.
  - Cool quickly in an ice bath. Store in fridge up to 5 days or freeze in portions up to 6 months.

notes: |
  **To Make Chicken Base (Reduced Stock):**
  - After straining, return stock to a clean pot and simmer uncovered until reduced by half or more.
  - Cool and store as a base for gravies, pan sauces, or soups. The flavor will be concentrated and gelatinous when chilled.

  **Variations:**
  - **Pho-Inspired Base:** Add a 3-inch piece of ginger (charred), 1 cinnamon stick, 2 star anise, 1 tsp coriander seeds, and 1 tsp fennel seeds during the simmer.
  - **Asian Broth:** Use lemongrass, ginger, scallion, and a touch of fish sauce for a Southeast Asian profile.
  - **Mexican Base:** Add epazote, dried guajillo or pasilla chili, and charred onion for a caldo-style stock.
  - **Herbaceous Variation:** Add tarragon, marjoram, or rosemary in the last 30 minutes for a French-forward note.
