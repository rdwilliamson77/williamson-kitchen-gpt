    There are two quintessential New England clam chowders: the first is made with hard-shell quahogs, 
    the second with soft-shell clams (see Steamer Clam Chowder, page 114). Both feature a rich creamy broth 
    with clams, potatoes, onion, celery, and salt pork or bacon. Quahogs and large cherrystones (which are really 
    just smaller quahogs) are plentiful in fish markets and make a powerful and briny clam chowder. 
    The broth quahogs produce is herbaceous, especially briny, and not the least bit delicate. 
    Its unique flavor permeates a chowder, and it needs aggressive flavors like garlic and bacon to complement it. 
    This chowder delivers huge flavor and a true taste of Cape Cod and the Bay State (Massachusetts). 
    Be generous with the parsley and chive garnish, since the colors of the chowder are otherwise neutral.

    The word quahog comes from the Abnaki (Native American) name for hard-shell clams, *quauhaug*. 
    These round hard-shell clams live in sand and mud flats, below the high-tide mark, where they can be dug or raked 
    at low tide. They are found only on the eastern seaboard of North America. However, two similar but smoother-shelled 
    clams from the West Coast, the butter clam and the Pacific littleneck clam, are not quahogs, but they do make a fine chowder. 
    The East Coast littleneck clams, top neck clams, and cherrystone clams are all small quahogs. For some unknown reason, 
    though, we only call the large ones (10 to 16 ounces) quahogs. The term *chowder clam* applies to any quahog that is too 
    large to be eaten raw.
  notes: >
    This chowder begins with an easy clam broth. Follow the procedure for basic clam broth on page 62, where I also give options 
    for using smaller clams like littlenecks.

    Make this chowder with either bacon or salt pork. I like both, but prefer bacon here.

    Serve in small cups as a starter with toasted common crackers or Pilot crackers or as a meal in bowls with crackers on the side. 
    If you have extra clams, make Clam Fritters (page 225). Skillet Corn Bread (page 219) or Corn Sticks (page 220) or Anadama Bread 
    (page 217) are good too. In New England, it is traditional to put a dollop of cold butter on top of each serving.

    For equipment, you will need an 8-quart pot with a tight-fitting lid (for steaming open the clams), a fine-mesh strainer, 
    a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot with a lid (for the chowder), a wooden spoon, and a ladle.
ingredients:
  - "8 pounds small quahogs or large cherrystone clams"
  - "4 ounces slab (unsliced) bacon, rind removed and cut into 1/3-inch dice"
  - "4 tablespoons unsalted butter"
  - "2 medium onions (12 to 14 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice"
  - "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped"
  - "2 stalks celery (4 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice"
  - "5 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped (2 teaspoons)"
  - "2 dried bay leaves"
  - "2 pounds Yukon Gold, Maine, PEI, or other all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice"
  - "Reserved clam broth (should yield 4 cups from steaming)"
  - "1 1/2 cups heavy cream (or up to 2 cups if desired)"
  - "Freshly ground black pepper"
  - "Kosher or sea salt, as needed"
for_garnish:
  - "2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley"
  - "2 tablespoons minced fresh chives"
instructions:
  - "Scrub and rinse clams. Steam open following instructions on page 64 of *50 Chowders*. You should have 4 cups of broth and 1 pound of clam meat. Strain broth and refrigerate. Dice clam meat into 1/2-inch pieces and refrigerate."
  - "In a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over low heat, cook bacon until golden. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat, leaving bacon in the pot."
  - "Add butter, onions, garlic, celery, thyme, and bay leaves. Sauté for about 10 minutes, until onions are softened but not browned."
  - "Add potatoes and reserved clam broth. Add water if needed to cover. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook vigorously for 10 minutes, until potatoes are soft on the outside but firm in the center. Smash a few potatoes against the side of the pot to release starch if needed."
  - "Remove from heat. Stir in diced clams and cream. Season with pepper and adjust salt if needed. Let chowder sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour or chill and reheat later."
  - "Reheat gently over low heat without boiling. Ladle into bowls, ensuring even distribution of clams and potatoes. Garnish with parsley and chives."
notes:
  - "Makes 10 cups. Serves 10 as a first course or 6 as a main course."
