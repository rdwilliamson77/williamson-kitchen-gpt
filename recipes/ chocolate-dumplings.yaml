      - "Dash salt"
  - section: "Dumplings"
    items:
      - "1 cup flour"
      - "1/2 cup sugar"
      - "2 tsp baking powder"
      - "1/2 tsp salt"
      - "3 Tbsp shortening"
      - "1 egg"
      - "2 Tbsp cocoa"
      - "1/3 cup milk"
      - "1 tsp vanilla"
instructions:
  - "Combine brown sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt in a skillet. Stir in water and cook over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Add butter and remove from heat."
  - "Sift dry ingredients for dumplings together in a bowl. Add shortening, egg, milk, and vanilla. Stir to blend, then beat for 1 minute."
  - "Return sauce to heat and bring back to a boil."
  - "Drop dumpling batter by spoonfuls into the simmering sauce. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently for 20 minutes."
  - "Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream."
notes:
  - "The sauce thickens slightly during simmering and becomes rich and chocolaty. For best results, don't lift the lid while the dumplings are cooking. This old-fashioned dessert is best enjoyed fresh and warm."
