    Originally devised as a way to use leftover stale French bread, bread pudding has become one of the most popular 
    classic New Orleans desserts. Every cook has a secret version. Commander’s is served hot from the oven with a thin 
    clear rum sauce. If there’s any left over, it’s perfect for their bread pudding soufflé.
  notes: >
    The custard should be soft, not firm, when done. This dish is excellent served hot and is also great with grilled 
    pineapple slices drizzled with the clear rum sauce.
ingredients:
  - item: "1 cup sugar"
  - item: "8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, softened"

clear_rum_sauce:
  - item: "1 cup sugar"
  - item: "2 3/4 cups water"
  - item: "1 cinnamon stick or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
  - item: "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"
  - item: "1/2 teaspoon cornstarch"
  - item: "1 tablespoon light or dark rum"

instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F."
  - "In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter. Add eggs, cream, cinnamon, vanilla, and raisins. Mix well."
  - "Pour mixture into a 9-inch square pan, 1 3/4 inches deep."
  - "Arrange bread slices flat in the mixture and let stand 5 minutes to soak. Turn over and soak 10 minutes more. Push bread down so most is covered, but do not break the bread."
  - "Set pan in a larger pan filled with water to 1/2 inch from top. Cover with foil."
  - "Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, uncovering during last 10 minutes to brown the top. Custard should remain soft."
  - "While pudding bakes, make sauce: combine sugar, 2 1/2 cups water, cinnamon, and butter in saucepan. Bring to boil."
  - "Dissolve cornstarch in remaining 1/4 cup water, stir into sauce, and simmer until clear. Remove from heat and stir in rum."
  - "To serve, spoon pudding onto dessert plates and pass the sauce separately."
notes:
  - "Clear rum sauce also pairs well with fresh pineapple slices. Heat pineapple (do not cook) and drizzle with sauce."
