  Like ciabatta, focaccia is a bread that hardly anyone in the United States knew about a couple of decades ago. It should be light and airy, and thick enough to slice horizontally to make into sandwiches. This is made without a pre-ferment, so you can start it in the morning and bake a batch for lunch.

ingredients:
  - 3½ cups / 485 g unbleached all-purpose flour, as needed
  - 2¼ tsp active dry / 1 Tbsp / 8.5 g instant yeast
  - 2 tsp fine sea salt
  - 1⅓ cups / 315 ml cool water, plus more as needed
  - 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 tsp instant (also called quick-rising or bread machine) yeast
  - 2 tsp finely chopped fresh rosemary
  - 2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
  - Kosher salt for sprinkling

instructions:

    1. Combine 2 cups / 285 g of the flour with the water, instant yeast, and salt in a bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the oil and herbs. Mix to make a sticky, shaggy dough. Cover and let stand for 20 minutes.

    2. Replace the paddle with the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed, adding enough of the remaining flour to create a smooth soft dough that doesn’t stick to the bowl. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes, scraping the dough down as needed. Mix in the rosemary and parsley. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface. Divide by hand, form into a floured round, cover with a kitchen towel, and let stand for about 5 minutes, just until slightly relaxed. Flatten the dough into a rectangle and transfer to a generously oiled 10-by-15-inch rimmed sheet pan. Roll out the dough and knead locally to distribute the herbs.

    3. Drape the dough with a towel. Let rest 10 minutes, then stretch the dough to fill the pan. If the dough doesn’t hold its shape, let it rest 10 minutes more and stretch again as needed. Cover with a towel and let stand for about 45 minutes, or until risen by about one-quarter. Meanwhile, position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat to 425°F. Just before baking, use your fingers to dimple the top of the pan, about ¼ inch.

    4. Drizzle olive oil over the surface of the pan and sprinkle with kosher salt. Dimple the top of the focaccia again one more time just before baking to deflate any large air bubbles. Sprinkle the dough with extra oil and sprinkle with kosher salt.

    5. Bake until the focaccia is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for at least 5 minutes. Cut into serving lengths and serve. Focaccia is best the day of baking.
