  A deeply flavored, gelatin-rich beef stock made from roasted bones, mirepoix, and aromatics. This is a foundational component in classic French cooking and serves as the base for sauces, gravies, soups, and braises. Simmered low and slow, then clarified through careful straining, it yields a luxurious, dark stock that holds up in any fine kitchen.

ingredients:
  - 5 lb beef bones (preferably joint, knuckle, and marrow bones)
  - 1–2 lb meaty bones or shank (optional, for extra richness)
  - 2 tbsp tomato paste
  - 1 large onion, quartered (skin on for color)
  - 2 carrots, chopped
  - 2 celery stalks, chopped
  - 1 head garlic, halved
  - 1 small bunch parsley stems
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 1 tsp black peppercorns, whole
  - 1 sprig thyme
  - 1 gallon cold water (plus more as needed)
  - optional: 1 leek, chopped and rinsed
  - optional: 1 parsnip, peeled and chopped

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange beef bones and meaty bones in a roasting pan. Roast for 45–60 minutes, turning once, until deeply browned.
  - In the last 10 minutes, add tomato paste and allow it to caramelize on the bones for extra depth.
  - Transfer bones to a large stockpot. Deglaze roasting pan with warm water, scraping up browned bits, and pour into the pot.
  - Add cold water to cover bones. Slowly bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Skim off any foam.
  - Add vegetables, herbs, and aromatics. Keep heat low to maintain a slow simmer; do not boil.
  - Simmer uncovered for 8–12 hours, adding water as needed to keep contents submerged.
  - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth. Let cool completely and store.

notes: |
  **To Make Beef Base (Demi-Glace Style):**
  - After straining, return stock to a clean pot and reduce until syrupy and gelatinous.
  - For a demi-glace, combine 1 part reduced stock with 1 part espagnole sauce and reduce again.
  - Store beef base in ice cube trays or small containers for use in sauces, pan reductions, or flavor-boosting any beef dish.

  **Variations:**
  - **Pho Bò-Style:** Add charred onion, charred ginger, 1–2 cinnamon sticks, 3 star anise, 1 tsp whole cloves, and 1 tsp cardamom pods during the simmer. Skip tomato paste.
  - **Birria-Inspired:** Add dried ancho and guajillo chiles, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1 tsp Mexican oregano, a stick of cinnamon, and cloves. Add a splash of vinegar or wine for tang.
  - **French Onion Base:** Use only joint bones (no tomato paste), simmer with a bundle of thyme and bay leaf. After straining, reduce the stock and use as the base for traditional soupe à l'oignon.
  - **Asian Hot Pot Base:** Include scallions, ginger, shiitake stems, and a dash of soy sauce or fish sauce for an umami-rich broth.
  - **Herbaceous European Variation:** Add rosemary, sage, and a few juniper berries for wild game or rustic stew bases.

  This stock recipe is adapted from classical Escoffier and CIA standards, balancing rich bone collagen with deeply roasted vegetables and aromatics. The tomato paste enhances umami and darkens the broth, a hallmark of haute cuisine stock making.
