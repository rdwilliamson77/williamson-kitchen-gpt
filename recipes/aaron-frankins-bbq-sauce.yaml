  All credit to Aaron Franklin but this sauce has been adopted as the official Williamson family barbeque sauce. If I'm going to spend 12 or 14 hours manning the smoker, I need a sauce that rises to the occasion and Aaron's sauce achieves that. He calls it a “sweet sauce,” though it's not overly sweet by BBQ standards. It's served at his restaurant and used as a general-purpose sauce, sometimes cut with vinegar to sauce ribs.

  I always feel like I’m doing something right when I make this sauce. It’s simple but has depth — kind of like the pitmaster mindset I try to channel.
