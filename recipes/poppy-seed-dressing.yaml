  A thick and creamy sweet dressing that balances acidity from vinegar with the brightness of
  grated onion and the signature crunch of poppy seeds. Often used for fruit salads or baby spinach with berries.

ingredients:
  - 1½ cups sugar
  - 2 tsp dry mustard
  - 2 tsp salt
  - 2/3 cup vinegar
  - 3 tbsp finely grated onion
  - 2 cups canola oul
  - 3 tbsp poppy seed

instructions:
  - Stir first five ingredients together.
  - Add oil and beat till thick.
  - Add poppy seed.
  - Delicious on fruit.

notes: >
  The original card called for "onion juice," which was likely intended to mean the juice or pulp
  from grated onion. Grating a sweet onion provides the right balance of flavor and consistency.
