If you want to get under my skin in the kitchen, just whip out the **jarlic**.

I’m all for shortcuts — but let’s be honest: peeling a clove of garlic isn’t exactly an act of heroism. It takes a few seconds. Maybe less. And in return, you get *actual* garlic — not some sad, flavorless slurry suspended in mystery liquid.

Just spend the extra minute. Use the fresh stuff. Your food (and your dignity) will thank you.
