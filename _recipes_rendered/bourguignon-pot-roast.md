ingredients:
- item: 3–4 lb chuck roast, well marbled
- item: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- item: 2 tbsp olive oil
- item: 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- item: 1 large yellow onion, sliced
- item: 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- item: 2 tbsp tomato paste
- item: 2 cups dry red wine (e.g., Burgundy, Côtes du Rhône, or cabernet)
- item: 2 cups beef stock (preferably homemade)
- item: 4–5 sprigs fresh thyme
- item: 2 bay leaves
- item: 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (optional but deepens flavor)
- item: 4 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
- item: 1 lb baby potatoes or halved Yukon Golds
- item: 8 oz cremini or white mushrooms, halved
- item: Chopped parsley, for garnish
instructions:
- Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
- Pat roast dry and season generously with salt and pepper.
- In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. Sear roast on all sides until
  well browned, 3–4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
- Lower heat to medium. Add butter, onions, and garlic. Sauté until soft and golden,
  about 6–8 minutes.
- Stir in tomato paste and cook 1–2 minutes to deepen flavor.
- Pour in red wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom. Simmer 5 minutes.
- Add beef stock, thyme, bay leaves, and Worcestershire (if using). Return roast to
  the pot and bring to a simmer.
- Cover and transfer to oven. Braise for 2.5 hours.
- Add carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms to the pot. Re-cover and braise another 1–1.5
  hours, or until meat and vegetables are fork-tender.
- Skim fat if needed. Discard thyme stems and bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning.
- Serve in shallow bowls with spoonfuls of broth, garnished with chopped parsley.
notes:
- This dish tastes even better the next day. Reheat gently to preserve texture.
- Use a bold, dry wine you’d enjoy drinking. Avoid sweet reds or cooking wine.
- For a thicker sauce, remove meat and vegetables after cooking and simmer liquid
  uncovered on the stove until slightly reduced, or stir in a cornstarch slurry.
