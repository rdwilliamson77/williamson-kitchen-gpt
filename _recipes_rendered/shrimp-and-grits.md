narrative: 'A Southern classic with creamy grits, smoky bacon, and tender shrimp in
  a white wine pan sauce.  This version adds brightness and depth while staying true
  to the dish’s comforting roots.

  '
ingredients:
  for the grits:
  - 2 cups stone-ground grits or coarse polenta
  - 4 cups half and half
  - 2 cups chicken stock
  - 1 tsp kosher salt
  - 4 tbsp butter
  - 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated
  for the shrimp:
  - 3 lb large raw shrimp, peeled and deveined
  - 6 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
  - 1 lb andioulle sausage
  - 1 medium yellow onion, finely diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1/2 cup dry white wine
  - 2 cups chicken stock
  - Juice of two lemons
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 6 sprigs thyme
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 3 tbsp butter
  - 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
  - kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
  - 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
  - 1/4 cup sliced scallions
instructions:
- Bring the stock and half and half to a simmer. Add salt and stir in grits. Reduce
  heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently. As the grits cook you'll likely need
  to fine tune the seasoning and the consistency by adding additional salt and dairy.
  Once final consistency is achieved, stir in butter and cheese.
- In a large skillet, cook chopped bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove with
  a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave 1–2 tbsp of bacon drippings in the skillet.
- Add the onion to the skillet. Sauté 5 minutes until soft. Add garlic and cook 1
  minute more.
- Add the butter and 2 tsp flour to make a roux. Cook until blond.
- Deglaze with white wine, scraping all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.
  Add chicken stock, the juice of 2 lemons, thyme, paprika, bay leaves, cayenne pepper,
  and reserved bits. Bring to a boil for 3–5 minutes. Fine tune seasoning, consistency,
  and volume. You should have a lightly thickened sauce rather than a thick gravy.
- Add the andioulle and cook for 2–3 minutes, followed by the shrimp cooking for an
  additional five minutes.
- Spoon shrimp and sauce over grits. Garnish with fresh parsley and scallions.
notes: 'This dish balances creamy richness with smoky and acidic notes. The wine is
  key to cutting through  the fat and lifting the dish.
