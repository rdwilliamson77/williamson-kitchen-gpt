# Bread Pudding with Rum Sauce

## Ingredients
- {'item': '1 cup sugar'}
- {'item': '8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, softened'}
- {'item': '5 eggs, beaten'}
- {'item': '2 cups heavy cream'}
- {'item': 'Dash of cinnamon'}
- {'item': '1 tablespoon vanilla extract'}
- {'item': '1/4 cup raisins'}
- {'item': '12 slices (1 inch thick) of fresh or stale French bread'}

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter. Add eggs, cream, cinnamon, vanilla, and raisins. Mix well.
3. Pour mixture into a 9-inch square pan, 1 3/4 inches deep.
4. Arrange bread slices flat in the mixture and let stand 5 minutes to soak. Turn over and soak 10 minutes more. Push bread down so most is covered, but do not break the bread.
5. Set pan in a larger pan filled with water to 1/2 inch from top. Cover with foil.
6. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, uncovering during last 10 minutes to brown the top. Custard should remain soft.
7. While pudding bakes, make sauce: combine sugar, 2 1/2 cups water, cinnamon, and butter in saucepan. Bring to boil.
8. Dissolve cornstarch in remaining 1/4 cup water, stir into sauce, and simmer until clear. Remove from heat and stir in rum.
9. To serve, spoon pudding onto dessert plates and pass the sauce separately.

## Notes
- Clear rum sauce also pairs well with fresh pineapple slices. Heat pineapple (do not cook) and drizzle with sauce.
