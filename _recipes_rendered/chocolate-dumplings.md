ingredients:

  items:
  - 3/4 cup brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup cocoa
  - 1 tsp corn starch
  - 2 cups water
  - 2 Tbsp butter
  - Dash salt
- section: Dumplings
  items:
  - 1 cup flour
  - 1/2 cup sugar
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 3 Tbsp shortening
  - 1 egg
  - 2 Tbsp cocoa
  - 1/3 cup milk
  - 1 tsp vanilla
instructions:
- Combine brown sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt in a skillet. Stir in water and
  cook over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Add butter and remove from
  heat.
- Sift dry ingredients for dumplings together in a bowl. Add shortening, egg, milk,
  and vanilla. Stir to blend, then beat for 1 minute.
- Return sauce to heat and bring back to a boil.
- Drop dumpling batter by spoonfuls into the simmering sauce. Reduce heat, cover,
  and simmer gently for 20 minutes.
- Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.
notes:
- The sauce thickens slightly during simmering and becomes rich and chocolaty. For
  best results, don't lift the lid while the dumplings are cooking. This old-fashioned
  dessert is best enjoyed fresh and warm.
