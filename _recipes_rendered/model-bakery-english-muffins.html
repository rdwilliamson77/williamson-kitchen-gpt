# The Model Bakery’s English Muffins

## Ingredients
- **Biga**
- ½ cup / 75 g bread flour
- ½ cup / 120 ml water
- ⅛ tsp instant (also called quick-rising or bread machine) yeast
- **Dough**
- 1⅓ cups / 315 ml water
- ¾ tsp instant (also called quick-rising or bread machine) yeast
- 1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1½ tsp fine sea salt
- 2⅓ cups / 510 g unbleached all-purpose flour, as needed
- ¼ cup / 35 g yellow cornmeal, preferably stone ground
- 6 Tbsp / 90 ml melted Clarified Butter (page 237), as needed

## Instructions
1. 1. **To make the biga:** At least 1 day before cooking the muffins, combine the flour, water, and yeast in a small bowl to make a sticky dough. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. The biga will rise slightly.

2. 2. **To make the dough:** Combine the biga, water, yeast, olive oil, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Affix the bowl to the mixer and fit it with the paddle attachment. Mix on low speed until the mixture looks creamy, about 1 minute. Mix in 1⅔ cups / 435 g of the flour to make a soft, sticky dough. Turn off the mixer, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let stand for 20 minutes. (To mix by hand, combine the water, biga, yeast, oil, and salt in a large bowl and break up the biga with a wooden spoon. Stir in some of the flour to make a cohesive but tacky dough. Cover and let stand for 20 minutes.)

3. 3. Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough that barely clears the mixer bowl. Replace the paddle with the dough hook. Knead on medium-low speed (if the dough climbs up the hook, just pull it down) until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and test its texture. It should feel tacky but not stick to the work surface. (To mix by hand, knead on a floured work surface, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is smooth and feels tacky, about 10 minutes.)

4. 4. Shape the dough into a ball. Oil a medium bowl. Put the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil, leaving the dough smooth-side up. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until almost doubled in volume, about 2 hours. (The dough can also be refrigerated for 8 to 12 hours. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before proceeding to the next step.)

5. 5. Using a bowl scraper, scrape the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut into twelve equal pieces. Shape each into a 4-in / 10-cm round. Sprinkle an even layer of cornmeal over a half-sheet pan. Place the rounds on the cornmeal about 1 in / 2.5 cm apart. Turn the rounds to coat both sides with cornmeal. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap. Let stand in a warm place until the rounds have increased in volume by half and a finger pressed into a round leaves an impression for a few seconds before filling up, about 1 hour.

6. 6. Melt 2 Tbsp of the clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium heat until melted and hot, but not smoking. In batches, add the dough rounds to the skillet. Cook, adjusting the heat as needed so the muffins brown without scorching, adding more clarified butter as needed. The undersides should be nicely browned, about 6 minutes. Turn and cook until the other sides are browned and the muffins are puffed, about 6 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel–lined half-sheet pan and let cool. (It will be tempting to eat these hot off the griddle, but let them stand for at least 20 minutes to complete the cooking with carry-over hea
