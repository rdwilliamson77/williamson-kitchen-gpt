# Sydney’s Strawberry Ricotta Toast

## Ingredients
- 4 thick slices brioche bread
- Butter, for griddling
- 3/4 cup ricotta cheese
- 1 tablespoon sugar (plus more for strawberries)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 cup fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
- fresh mint

## Instructions
1. In a small bowl, toss the sliced strawberries with a spoonful of sugar and set aside to macerate while preparing the toast.
2. In another bowl, mix the ricotta with sugar and cinnamon until smooth and slightly fluffy.
3. Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a bit of butter.
4. Griddle the brioche slices until golden brown on both sides, about 2–3 minutes per side.
5. Spread the cinnamon-sugar ricotta mixture over the warm brioche slices.
6. Top with the sugared strawberries and finish with a sprinkle of lemon zest and garnish with a sprig of mint.
7. Serve immediately.

## Notes
- Optionally, drizzle with honey or a dusting of powdered sugar before serving.
- This is best made with high-quality whole milk ricotta and ripe strawberries.
