# Ruth Williamson’s Fried Pies

## Ingredients
- dough
- filling

## Instructions
1. Blend dry ingredients for dough and cut in Crisco.
2. Add cold water a little at a time and form dough.
3. Separate into 8 balls and roll out in circles.
4. Combine flour and sugar for filling and stir in juice. Heat till bubbly and thickened, then add fruit. Cool.
5. Put about 2 Tbsp. of cooled fruit in center of each circle.
6. Wet the edges of the circles with a mixture of flour and water. Fold over and seal with tines of a fork.
7. Pierce with fork.
8. Fry in medium hot oil about 30 seconds on each side. Turn, grasping pie with spatula on one side and a spoon on the other side.
9. If fruit oozes out, fold that end up out of the oil with spatula.
10. Cool on paper towels and drizzle with mixture of powdered sugar and milk.
11. You can make these — they’re worth the effort, but I have to confess that 30 years ago, at my initial effort,  I was so exasperated at the result that I threw the skillet against the wall — the pies were much better then!   — BW
