# Buttermilk Biscuits

## Ingredients
- 3 cups / 435 g unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out the dough
- 2½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ¾ tsp fine sea salt
- ¾ cup / 170 g cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-in / 12-mm pieces
- ¾ cup / 180 ml buttermilk
- ½ cup / 120 ml half-and-half, plus more for brushing the biscuits

## Instructions
1. 1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400°F / 200°C / gas 6. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. 2. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together into a medium bowl. Add the butter and toss to coat with the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly, with some pea-size pieces of butter. Whisk the buttermilk and half-and-half together. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the buttermilk mixture. Stir to thoroughly moisten the dry ingredients, including any crumbly bits in the bottom of the bowl. (You may not use all of the liquid.) Knead the dough in the bowl just a few times, until it comes together into a moist dough.

3. 3. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface. Dust the top with flour. Pat or roll the dough about ¾ in / 2 cm thick. Using a biscuit cutter 2¼ in / 6 cm in diameter, cut out biscuits and place them 1 in / 2.5 cm apart on the lined baking sheet. Gather the scraps, gently knead together, and repeat, cutting out more biscuits until the dough is used up. Brush the tops of the biscuits lightly with half-and-half.

4. 4. Bake until the biscuits are golden brown on the top and bottom (lift up a biscuit to check), 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm. (The biscuits are best the day they are baked.)
