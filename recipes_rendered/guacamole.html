# Guacamole

## Ingredients
- 6 ripe Hass avocados, divided
- 1/2 cup finely diced white onion, divided
- 2 small ripe tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- 1–2 serrano peppers, finely minced (to taste)
- Juice of 2 limes
- Splash of fresh orange juice (about 1 tbsp)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided
- 1 tsp kosher salt, or to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1 tsp finely chopped fresh oregano

## Instructions
1. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and dice the flesh while still in the skin using a paring knife. Then scoop out into a bowl. Set aside half of the avocado chunks for folding in at the end.
2. In a molcajete (or mortar and pestle), combine half of the diced onion, half of the cilantro, the minced serrano, salt, and chopped oregano. Grind into a coarse paste to release oils and flavors.
3. Transfer the paste to a mixing bowl and add the lime juice, orange juice, and remaining onion and cilantro. Stir to combine.
4. Add half of the avocado and mash gently into the mixture, preserving some texture.
5. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
6. Fold in the remaining avocado chunks and the seeded, chopped tomato. Mix gently to maintain a rustic consistency.
7. Serve immediately, or press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent browning.

## Notes
- To achieve clean, uniform chunks, dice the avocado in the shell before scooping—it saves time and helps preserve texture.
- Using a molcajete to grind the aromatics creates a richer, deeper flavor base without over-mixing the avocado.
- Tomatoes should be seeded before chopping to prevent excess moisture.
- Adjust serrano heat to taste, or substitute with jalapeño for a milder flavor.
- **Presentation tip**: For an elevated table presentation, line a low serving bowl, wide platter, or even a traditional molcajete with large green leaf lettuce. Mound the guacamole in the center and garnish with fresh lime wedges around the edges.
