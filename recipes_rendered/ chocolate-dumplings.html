# Chocolate Dumplings

## Ingredients
- {'section': 'Sauce', 'items': ['3/4 cup brown sugar', '1/4 cup cocoa', '1 tsp corn starch', '2 cups water', '2 Tbsp butter', 'Dash salt']}
- {'section': 'Dumplings', 'items': ['1 cup flour', '1/2 cup sugar', '2 tsp baking powder', '1/2 tsp salt', '3 Tbsp shortening', '1 egg', '2 Tbsp cocoa', '1/3 cup milk', '1 tsp vanilla']}

## Instructions
1. Combine brown sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt in a skillet. Stir in water and cook over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Add butter and remove from heat.
2. Sift dry ingredients for dumplings together in a bowl. Add shortening, egg, milk, and vanilla. Stir to blend, then beat for 1 minute.
3. Return sauce to heat and bring back to a boil.
4. Drop dumpling batter by spoonfuls into the simmering sauce. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently for 20 minutes.
5. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.

## Notes
- The sauce thickens slightly during simmering and becomes rich and chocolaty. For best results, don't lift the lid while the dumplings are cooking. This old-fashioned dessert is best enjoyed fresh and warm.
