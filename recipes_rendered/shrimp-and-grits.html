# Shrimp and Grits

## Ingredients
- for the grits
- for the shrimp

## Instructions
1. Bring the stock and half and half to a simmer. Add salt and stir in grits. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently. As the grits cook you'll likely need to fine tune the seasoning and the consistency by adding additional salt and dairy. Once final consistency is achieved, stir in butter and cheese.
2. In a large skillet, cook chopped bacon over medium heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. Leave 1–2 tbsp of bacon drippings in the skillet.
3. Add the onion to the skillet. Sauté 5 minutes until soft. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.
4. Add the butter and 2 tsp flour to make a roux. Cook until blond.
5. Deglaze with white wine, scraping all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add chicken stock, the juice of 2 lemons, thyme, paprika, bay leaves, cayenne pepper, and reserved bits. Bring to a boil for 3–5 minutes. Fine tune seasoning, consistency, and volume. You should have a lightly thickened sauce rather than a thick gravy.
6. Add the andioulle and cook for 2–3 minutes, followed by the shrimp cooking for an additional five minutes.
7. Spoon shrimp and sauce over grits. Garnish with fresh parsley and scallions.
