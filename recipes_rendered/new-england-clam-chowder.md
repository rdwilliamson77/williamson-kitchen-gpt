ingredients:
- 8 pounds small quahogs or large cherrystone clams
- 4 ounces slab (unsliced) bacon, rind removed and cut into 1/3-inch dice
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 medium onions (12 to 14 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 2 stalks celery (4 ounces), cut into 1/3-inch dice
- 5 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped (2 teaspoons)
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 2 pounds Yukon Gold, Maine, PEI, or other all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into
  1/2-inch dice
- Reserved clam broth (should yield 4 cups from steaming)
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream (or up to 2 cups if desired)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Kosher or sea salt, as needed
instructions:
- Scrub and rinse clams. Steam open following instructions on page 64 of *50 Chowders*.
  You should have 4 cups of broth and 1 pound of clam meat. Strain broth and refrigerate.
  Dice clam meat into 1/2-inch pieces and refrigerate.
- In a 4- to 6-quart heavy pot over low heat, cook bacon until golden. Pour off all
  but 1 tablespoon of fat, leaving bacon in the pot.
- Add butter, onions, garlic, celery, thyme, and bay leaves. Saut√© for about 10 minutes,
  until onions are softened but not browned.
- Add potatoes and reserved clam broth. Add water if needed to cover. Bring to a boil,
  cover, and cook vigorously for 10 minutes, until potatoes are soft on the outside
  but firm in the center. Smash a few potatoes against the side of the pot to release
  starch if needed.
- Remove from heat. Stir in diced clams and cream. Season with pepper and adjust salt
  if needed. Let chowder sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour or chill and reheat
  later.
- Reheat gently over low heat without boiling. Ladle into bowls, ensuring even distribution
  of clams and potatoes. Garnish with parsley and chives.
notes:
- Makes 10 cups. Serves 10 as a first course or 6 as a main course.
