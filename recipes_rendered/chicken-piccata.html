# Chicken Piccata

## Ingredients
- 4 chicken breasts
- 2–3 lemons
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1 jar capers
- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 lb linguine
- 3–4 eggs
- Vegetable oil (for pan-frying)

## Instructions
1. {'Prep the chicken': ['Split the chicken breasts and pound them flat — Dad recommends placing them in a gallon freezer bag and pounding with a pollard.', 'Season generously with salt and pepper.', 'Dip in egg wash, then dredge in flour until well coated.']}
2. {'Fry the chicken': ['Heat 1 cup of vegetable oil in a pan.', 'Fry the chicken until golden. Set aside.', {'Dad says': '“The bits left in the pan are everything. They should be golden or peanut-colored, never black. If they blacken, you’ve scorched the oil — tough to recover from that.”'}]}
3. {'Build the sauce': ['Scoop out all but 1 tablespoon of oil and add 1 tablespoon of the used flour.', 'Whisk constantly and deglaze with white wine.', 'Once smooth, add the chicken stock, juice of 2 lemons, and a generous spoonful of capers.', 'Bring to a simmer.', 'Return the chicken to the pan, layer lemon slices on top, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.']}
4. {'Cook pasta simultaneously': ['Boil heavily salted water.', 'Add linguine just as the chicken goes back into the sauce.', 'When pasta is al dente, the piccata is usually ready.']}
5. {'Final touches': [{'Evaluate the sauce': 'it should be loose but cling to pasta.'}, 'Add reserved pasta water if needed to adjust the consistency.']}
6. {'Serve': ['Plate the chicken over linguine.', 'Serve with warm, crusty baguette for soaking up sauce.']}
