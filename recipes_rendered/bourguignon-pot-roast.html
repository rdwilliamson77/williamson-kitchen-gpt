# Bourguignon Pot Roast

## Ingredients
- {'item': '3–4 lb chuck roast, well marbled'}
- {'item': 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper'}
- {'item': '2 tbsp olive oil'}
- {'item': '2 tbsp unsalted butter'}
- {'item': '1 large yellow onion, sliced'}
- {'item': '4 cloves garlic, smashed'}
- {'item': '2 tbsp tomato paste'}
- {'item': '2 cups dry red wine (e.g., Burgundy, Côtes du Rhône, or cabernet)'}
- {'item': '2 cups beef stock (preferably homemade)'}
- {'item': '4–5 sprigs fresh thyme'}
- {'item': '2 bay leaves'}
- {'item': '1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce (optional but deepens flavor)'}
- {'item': '4 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks'}
- {'item': '1 lb baby potatoes or halved Yukon Golds'}
- {'item': '8 oz cremini or white mushrooms, halved'}
- {'item': 'Chopped parsley, for garnish'}

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. Pat roast dry and season generously with salt and pepper.
3. In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat olive oil. Sear roast on all sides until well browned, 3–4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
4. Lower heat to medium. Add butter, onions, and garlic. Sauté until soft and golden, about 6–8 minutes.
5. Stir in tomato paste and cook 1–2 minutes to deepen flavor.
6. Pour in red wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom. Simmer 5 minutes.
7. Add beef stock, thyme, bay leaves, and Worcestershire (if using). Return roast to the pot and bring to a simmer.
8. Cover and transfer to oven. Braise for 2.5 hours.
9. Add carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms to the pot. Re-cover and braise another 1–1.5 hours, or until meat and vegetables are fork-tender.
10. Skim fat if needed. Discard thyme stems and bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning.
11. Serve in shallow bowls with spoonfuls of broth, garnished with chopped parsley.

## Notes
- This dish tastes even better the next day. Reheat gently to preserve texture.
- Use a bold, dry wine you’d enjoy drinking. Avoid sweet reds or cooking wine.
- For a thicker sauce, remove meat and vegetables after cooking and simmer liquid uncovered on the stove until slightly reduced, or stir in a cornstarch slurry.
