category: stock
servings: 4 quarts
time: null
narrative: ''
ingredients:
- 5 lb beef bones (preferably joint, knuckle, and marrow bones)
- 1–2 lb meaty bones or shank (optional, for extra richness)
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 large onion, quartered (skin on for color)
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 1 head garlic, halved
- 1 small bunch parsley stems
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp black peppercorns, whole
- 1 sprig thyme
- 1 gallon cold water (plus more as needed)
- optional: 1 leek, chopped and rinsed
- optional: 1 parsnip, peeled and chopped
instructions:
- Preheat oven to 450°F. Arrange beef bones and meaty bones in a roasting pan. Roast
  for 45–60 minutes, turning once, until deeply browned.
- In the last 10 minutes, add tomato paste and allow it to caramelize on the bones
  for extra depth.
- Transfer bones to a large stockpot. Deglaze roasting pan with warm water, scraping
  up browned bits, and pour into the pot.
- Add cold water to cover bones. Slowly bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
  Skim off any foam.
- Add vegetables, herbs, and aromatics. Keep heat low to maintain a slow simmer; do
  not boil.
- Simmer uncovered for 8–12 hours, adding water as needed to keep contents submerged.
- Strain through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth. Let cool completely and store.
notes: '**To Make Beef Base (Demi-Glace Style):**

  - After straining, return stock to a clean pot and reduce until syrupy and gelatinous.

  - For a demi-glace, combine 1 part reduced stock with 1 part espagnole sauce and
  reduce again.

  - Store beef base in ice cube trays or small containers for use in sauces, pan reductions,
  or flavor-boosting any beef dish.


  **Variations:**

  - **Pho Bò-Style:** Add charred onion, charred ginger, 1–2 cinnamon sticks, 3 star
  anise, 1 tsp whole cloves, and 1 tsp cardamom pods during the simmer. Skip tomato
  paste.

  - **Birria-Inspired:** Add dried ancho and guajillo chiles, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 1
  tsp Mexican oregano, a stick of cinnamon, and cloves. Add a splash of vinegar or
  wine for tang.

  - **French Onion Base:** Use only joint bones (no tomato paste), simmer with a bundle
  of thyme and bay leaf. After straining, reduce the stock and use as the base for
  traditional soupe à l''oignon.

  - **Asian Hot Pot Base:** Include scallions, ginger, shiitake stems, and a dash
  of soy sauce or fish sauce for an umami-rich broth.

  - **Herbaceous European Variation:** Add rosemary, sage, and a few juniper berries
  for wild game or rustic stew bases.
