narrative: 'A hearty, crowd-sized gumbo ideal for holidays or gatherings. The oven-browned
  flour shortcut makes a complex roux more accessible while still delivering on flavor.
  File powder should be added off-heat to avoid stringiness or bitterness.

  '
ingredients:
- 1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon bacon drippings
- 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 1 1/2 cups celery, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 (28 oz) can whole tomatoes
- 1 (16 oz) can tomato sauce
- 3 cups water
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 2 pounds shrimp, cleaned
- 1 1/2 pounds crab meat
- 1 (16 oz) package okra
- File powder, to taste
- Tabasco sauce (optional)
instructions:
- Combine bacon drippings and flour in a large pot over medium heat. Stir constantly
  until roux is dark brown. This can take time.
- (Optional shortcut: Tom recommends spreading the flour on a baking sheet and browning
    in a 450Â°F oven, stirring frequently until browned. Then combine with bacon drippings
    in pot.)
- Stir in onions, celery, and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until onions are
  clear.
- Add whole tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, broth, salt, and pepper. Simmer over medium
  heat for 1 hour.
- Add shrimp, crab meat, and okra. Simmer 20 minutes.
- Stir in Worcestershire sauce and simmer another 10 minutes.
- Add file powder and Tabasco to taste. Do not boil after adding file.
notes: 'Makes 1 gallon. Best served with rice or crusty bread. File thickens the gumbo
  and adds a subtle earthy flavor.
