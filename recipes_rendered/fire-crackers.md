narrative: 'This is one of those recipes that’s impossible to stop eating — everyone
  asks for the recipe. It''s a popular Southern snack, especially during holidays
  or tailgates. Prepare a day ahead so the flavor soaks into the crackers.

  '
ingredients:
- 1 box (16 oz) saltine crackers (about 4 sleeves)
- 1 cup canola oil (or another neutral oil)
- 1 oz packet dry ranch seasoning mix
- 2 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
- 1 teaspoon onion powder (optional)
instructions:
- In a large mixing bowl or zip-top bag, combine the canola oil, ranch seasoning,
  crushed red pepper, and optional garlic/onion powder.
- Stir or shake vigorously until the mixture is fully emulsified.
- Add the crackers and gently turn or shake until every cracker is evenly coated.
- Transfer to a large airtight container or gallon zip-top bag.
- Let sit for at least 12 hours (24 is better), gently turning occasionally to redistribute
  the seasoning.
- Serve as-is or with sliced cheese, pimento cheese, or cold beer.
notes: '- These store well for up to a week in an airtight container. - The spice
  level can be adjusted — 1 tbsp red pepper makes them milder, 2 tbsp is classic.
