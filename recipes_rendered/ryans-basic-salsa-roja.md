narrative: 'This salsa forms the base for countless variations and always delivers
  smoky, balanced flavor with the right punch of acidity and heat.

  '
ingredients:
- 2–3 lbs ripe Roma tomatoes, halved
- 1 large onion, halved
- 4–6 garlic cloves, unpeeled
- 2–3 serrano peppers
- 1 small fresh tomato, diced
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1–2 limes
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
instructions:
- Preheat broiler.
- Place Roma tomato halves skin-side up on a sheet pan with onion, garlic, and peppers.
- Broil for 8–10 minutes, or until skins blister and blacken.
- Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly.
- Peel garlic; remove pepper stems.
- Blend charred vegetables in a food processor along with the fresh diced tomato.
- Add lime juice, salt, pepper, and cilantro. Pulse until just combined, leaving some
  texture.
- Strain excess liquid for a thicker consistency, if desired.
notes: 'This salsa holds well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. It improves in
  flavor overnight. Always taste for seasoning before serving, as acidity and heat
  can mellow over time.
