narrative: null
ingredients:
- 4 chicken breasts
- 2–3 lemons
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1 jar capers
- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 lb linguine
- 3–4 eggs
- Vegetable oil (for pan-frying)
instructions:
- Prep the chicken:
  - Split the chicken breasts and pound them flat — Dad recommends placing them in
    a gallon freezer bag and pounding with a pollard.
  - Season generously with salt and pepper.
  - Dip in egg wash, then dredge in flour until well coated.
- Fry the chicken:
  - Heat 1 cup of vegetable oil in a pan.
  - Fry the chicken until golden. Set aside.
  - Dad says: “The bits left in the pan are everything. They should be golden or peanut-colored,
      never black. If they blacken, you’ve scorched the oil — tough to recover from
      that.”
- Build the sauce:
  - Scoop out all but 1 tablespoon of oil and add 1 tablespoon of the used flour.
  - Whisk constantly and deglaze with white wine.
  - Once smooth, add the chicken stock, juice of 2 lemons, and a generous spoonful
    of capers.
  - Bring to a simmer.
  - Return the chicken to the pan, layer lemon slices on top, cover, and simmer for
    10 minutes.
- Cook pasta simultaneously:
  - Boil heavily salted water.
  - Add linguine just as the chicken goes back into the sauce.
  - When pasta is al dente, the piccata is usually ready.
- Final touches:
  - Evaluate the sauce: it should be loose but cling to pasta.
  - Add reserved pasta water if needed to adjust the consistency.
- Serve:
  - Plate the chicken over linguine.
  - Serve with warm, crusty baguette for soaking up sauce.
