# Corn Chowder

## Ingredients
- 3 medium ears fresh yellow or bicolor corn
- 4 ounces slab (unsliced) bacon, rind removed and cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion (7 to 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 1/2 large red bell pepper (6 to 8 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 2 to 3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves removed and chopped (1/2 teaspoon)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/8 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 pound Yukon Gold, Maine, PEI, or other all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
- 3 cups Chicken Stock or Chicken Broth
- Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
- 1 cup heavy cream

## Instructions
1. Husk the corn. Carefully remove silk and rub ears with a towel. Cut kernels from cobs and place in a bowl (you should have about 2 cups). Scrape down cobs to extract milky substance and add to corn.
2. In a 3- to 4-quart heavy pot, add diced bacon over low heat. Cook until crisp and golden. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat, leaving bacon in the pot.
3. Add butter, onion, red pepper, thyme, cumin, and turmeric. Saut√© for about 8 minutes, until vegetables are tender but not browned.
4. Add corn kernels, potatoes, and stock. Turn up heat, cover, and boil vigorously for 10 minutes. Some potatoes will break up slightly; most should retain shape.
5. Reduce heat to medium. Season with salt and pepper. Stir cornstarch slurry into pot, stirring constantly. Bring back to a boil and cook until thickened slightly. Remove from heat and stir in cream. Adjust seasoning if needed.
6. If not serving immediately, let cool and refrigerate. Otherwise, let sit at room temperature up to 1 hour for flavors to meld.
7. When ready to serve, reheat over low heat without boiling. Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with chives.

## Notes
- Makes about 7 cups. Serve as a first course or a light meal. This recipe is particularly good with common crackers, corn sticks, or skillet cornbread.
