narrative: 'A puffed oven pancake with roots in southern Sweden, adapted lovingly
  through generations in the Witherspoon family. Best eaten hot with lemon juice and
  powdered sugar or a dollop of jam.  It rises dramatically in the oven—then falls—and
  that’s the beauty of it.

  '

- 5 eggs
- 3 cups milk
- 1/8 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- powdered sugar (for serving)
- lemon juice (for serving)
- preserves (for serving)
instructions:
- Preheat oven to 450°F.
- Melt butter in a 9x13 glass baking dish.
- In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs, then blend in milk, sugar, salt, and flour until
  smooth.
- Pour batter over the melted butter in the hot dish.
- Bake for 20 minutes until puffed and golden.
- Once it falls, cut into squares and serve with either preserves or powdered sugar
  with a drizzle of lemon juice.
